# Solanum

A short program based on the dialogue options with Solanum from the Outer Wilds game.

##

I named my new laptop 'Solanum', and thought it might be fun to put together a program in python allowing one to 'talk' to Solanum via a similar method to what is provided in the Outer Wilds game. When running from the command line, the user will be able to input dialogue options via a dropdown menu (similar to the tiles used in game) and Solanum will respond with their in game written comments.

1. Step one was building a single drop down menu.
2. Step two was to then build two drop down menus within the same object that allowed different selections to be clicked.
3. Step 3 is tying in diaglog responses to user selection
4. Step 4 (?) Perhaps adding a button for the user to click after drop down menu items are selected.
